<PRE>Dear all,

this is my first mail to this list, and I am very much a beginner in 
using opendx. I have been using gnuplot and other tools for a while to 
plot results of measurements and simulations, and recently started to 
investigate the possibilities of opendx when it comes to visualizing 
time-stepped data and interpolation. I am an architect, and most of my 
data is from measurements of radiation, light simulation, often with 
positions given angular.

Now my very first use of opendx is to be as follow:  I have a file 
containing lots of data organized in three columns:

theta phi intensity

The data is completely scattered, so there is no rule like column or row 
priority - the intensities are measured by a moving sensor which records 
(angular) position and the signal.

I want to create two plots, one for theta 0-90 and one for theta 90-180, 
in both cases phi 0-360. The result should be something like a 
equiangular projection, so it would be a disk with the radius being 
dependant on theta. The intensity (data) should be plotted as the 
z-value with a color map.

What I did so far is:

FileSelector

Import

Mark positions

Include (I use [0,0] for min and [90.360] for max to get the first plot, 
and [90,0] for min and [180.360] for the second

Unmark

Mark positions

Compute (here I compute x,y from theta, phi)

Unmark

Connect

Facenormals

Rubbersheet

Color

Image

(I also have a second path from the data after the Include-module to 
create a colormap)

My first question - is this correct so far? The result somehow looks 
like what I expected though a bit spikey, but that MAY be because of my 
data, What I would like to have now in a second step is

a) I would like to scale the height of my z-values so that the maximum 
becomes equal to the diameter of the disk
b) I would like to find out how to smooth the z-values
c) I would like to plot both, the theta 0-90 and 90-180, into two plots 
in the same presentation. Is collect the way to do so, after 
transforming the plots?

After that, I would like to try an alternative way to plot the data, 
this time for theta 0-180 in one. To do so, I would create a sphere with 
the data value being used as radius. How can I get this? I would have to 
access both position and data information from within one compute 
module. I understand that I have two inputs, so I could connect the 
first to the marked positions and the second to the unmarked data. The 
positions would be a.0 (theta) and a.1(phi), but I could not get this 
when I tried to refer to the second input as b.0 - what is wrong?

I can post my net-file if wanted, I do not attach it now as I am not 
sure about the policies for binary attachments for this list.

Thank you, I hope this is not too much FAQ, regards

Lars O. Grobe.
