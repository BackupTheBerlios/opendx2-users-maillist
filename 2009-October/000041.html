<PRE>Hi Greg!
&gt;<i> Anyone out there?   I'm wondering if anyone is interested in some work I've been doing on OpenDX - I've replaced the multi-process model with a multi-threaded one, enabling a much (much!) simplified memory manager.  This enables me to remove the limit on memory size (though I bet you'd better not allocate any individual object larger than 2GB).  It'll just consume virtual-memory page-space until it hits an arbitrary limit (suggestions?) when it will begin to flush the cache.  Fragmentation is also much less of a problem.  
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Sounds great. Just one thought - is it still possible to use the 
multi-thread one, or did you really replace it? I am asking because I 
remember when I was working on clusters, that for some solution process 
migration works flawless, but process migration due to shared memory is 
not implemented on some cluster platforms (that was the case for mosix 
when I last used it).

About the frequency of postings here, obviously most discussion moved to 
the web-based forums. I also prefer mailing lists, but I am aware that 
today web-forums are easier to find and use by many. Would be great to 
link the mailing list and the forums, of course...

Cheers, Lars.
