<PRE>Hi Joel!
&gt;<i> way already. You may be interested in the OpenDX forum at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.opendx.org/cgi-bin/forum/YaBB.pl">http://www.opendx.org/cgi-bin/forum/YaBB.pl</A>
</I>&gt;<i> It gets more readers than the mailing list, I think.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Unforunately yes, I prefer the mailing list comfort, but thank you for 
the hint. Just got registred there.

&gt;&gt;<i> I found that there is the Post module which is supposed to do some 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interpolation. I just do not know how to use it - where in my net should 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it appear, just after the Connect module?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you want Refine, not Post. And yes, after Connect should do it.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Well, the problem is that connect gives my straight connections, so I 
have a linear interpolation through all data points. I would like to use 
something like a spline interpolation instead, which would lead to a 
surface not going through all those points which are far off. As far as 
I understand it, refine would only increase the number of points but 
still make sure that any data point is touched by the surface, right?
&gt;<i> The error message refers to the number of positions/data values, not to
</I>&gt;<i> their dimensionality. Your original compute expression is probably
</I>&gt;<i> correct (at least, it would not be the cause of that error message).
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is upstream of Compute. Somehow, the number of positions
</I>&gt;<i> received by Compute's a input is different from the number of data
</I>&gt;<i> values received by the b input. (You didn't insert a Post, did you?)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>No, worse, there was an include-statement on the positions, but I had 
connected the compute's second input directly to the input (in front of 
the include), so it got the unfiltered data. Thank you for pointing me 
the way, as I had completely misunderstood the meaning of the error message!

I have got my sphere now after adding a second route behind my mark 
module -&gt; include module through an unmark. So I get two data streams 
from the include now, one is getting directly piped into the compute's 
master input, while the second input's stream is first unmarked. This 
gives me the positions as a.x and a.y and the data as b. Perfect!


I have to figure out yet how to create a nice spherical surface with the 
data values as delt-radius, so far I got only the showpositions to prove 
that the coordinate computation works. I had hoped that rubbersheet 
would do this, but it is only for flat carthesian positions and actually 
translating the data value to a elevation is already done in my compute 
now. So I guess I need a closer look at the isosurface module for what I 
want to do...?

Thank you for the comments! Also Giulio has been a great help (I was not 
aware that my replys got addressed only to the private mail, but not the 
list). I can say that DX is much more fun then I was hoping for so far...

Cheers Lars.
