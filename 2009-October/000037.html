<PRE>Dear all,

I have partially achieved what I wanted to do by trial and error. 
However, there are some points where I obviously got stuck:

&gt;<i> My first question - is this correct so far? The result somehow looks 
</I>&gt;<i> like what I expected though a bit spikey, but that MAY be because of my 
</I>&gt;<i> data, What I would like to have now in a second step is
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I found that there is the Post module which is supposed to do some 
interpolation. I just do not know how to use it - where in my net should 
it appear, just after the Connect module?

&gt;<i> b) I would like to find out how to smooth the z-values
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>See above...

&gt;<i> c) I would like to plot both, the theta 0-90 and 90-180, into two plots 
</I>&gt;<i> in the same presentation. Is collect the way to do so, after 
</I>&gt;<i> transforming the plots?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I achieved this by translating one plot.

&gt;<i> After that, I would like to try an alternative way to plot the data, 
</I>&gt;<i> this time for theta 0-180 in one. To do so, I would create a sphere with 
</I>&gt;<i> the data value being used as radius. How can I get this? I would have to 
</I>&gt;<i> access both position and data information from within one compute 
</I>&gt;<i> module. I understand that I have two inputs, so I could connect the 
</I>&gt;<i> first to the marked positions and the second to the unmarked data. The 
</I>&gt;<i> positions would be a.0 (theta) and a.1(phi), but I could not get this 
</I>&gt;<i> when I tried to refer to the second input as b.0 - what is wrong?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>This is where I am completely lost now. I tried to use the positions 
(a.x, a.y) and the data value (b) with a compute module, to get (x,y,z). 
However, as a is a field with two scalars, while b contains only one 
data value, I get an error (&quot;Bad paramater: Inputs must be of same 
length / Input 1 not matching the master (input 0).&quot;). So I tried to 
change my input b by passing it through a second compute module, which 
was simply to add the second scalar: [(a),(0)] - but this did not work, 
same error message. So how do I match the two inputs, to be able to 
modify the position by the data value?

Thank you, regards

Lars O. Grobe.
