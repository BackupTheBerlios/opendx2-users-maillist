<PRE>Hi, Marco -

I'll be distributing the code I've been working on - I just want to do a bit more testing.  I think I'll be using a SourceForge repository.

The changes I've been making affect the standard shared-memory model of OpenDX.  The work I did a long time ago on an MPI-based distributed-memory version was built on top of the shared-memory model; whether that is multi-process or multi-thread should be immaterial.  However, I'm not sure I'm going to try to resurrect that stuff; it was only a prototype and never really became real.

I don't believe the system has been flushing the cache at all, in the past.  Thats why it would run until it ran out of memory, take a few half-hearted efforts at scavenging, and then stop.  At which point you could explicitly flush the cache, and it'd proceed along just fine - until it ran out of memory again.   I have a test progeam that steps up and back through 1000 isovalues; the old code would not run very long before stopping with an out-of-memory error.   With the fix in, even in very constrained memory it keeps running a *long* time.

Greg

It would be great if you could post the patches, so that they remain
archived somewhere, waiting for someone to re-vitalize the project.
Do the multi-thread model rules out the possibility to use mpi?

I'm also very interested in the cache bug you mentioned in the forum.

Thanks,

Marco
